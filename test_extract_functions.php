To address your request, I'll provide information on each CWE you've listed. Since CVEs were not provided, I'll focus on the CWEs. For each CWE, I'll include a brief description, potential solutions, and recommendations for mitigation. Note that the severity of CWEs can vary depending on the context and implementation, so I'll provide general guidance.

### CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag
- **Description**: This weakness occurs when cookies are not marked with the 'HttpOnly' attribute, making them accessible to client-side scripts and potentially vulnerable to theft via cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Solution**: Ensure that all sensitive cookies are set with the 'HttpOnly' flag to prevent access from JavaScript.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Review your web application's cookie settings and update them to include the 'HttpOnly' attribute where applicable.

### CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames
- **Description**: This issue arises when an application does not properly restrict the rendering of UI layers or frames, potentially allowing clickjacking attacks.
- **Solution**: Implement frame-busting techniques or use the Content Security Policy (CSP) frame-ancestors directive to control which sites can frame your content.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Update your web server configuration to include appropriate CSP headers and test your application for clickjacking vulnerabilities.

### CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute
- **Description**: This occurs when cookies used in HTTPS sessions are not marked with the 'Secure' attribute, making them susceptible to being sent over unencrypted connections.
- **Solution**: Set the 'Secure' attribute on all cookies used in HTTPS sessions to ensure they are only transmitted over secure channels.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Audit your cookie settings and ensure that the 'Secure' attribute is applied to all cookies in HTTPS contexts.

### CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
- **Description**: This weakness involves the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users, which can occur through various means such as error messages, logs, or unsecured data storage.
- **Solution**: Implement proper access controls, sanitize error messages, and ensure sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Conduct a thorough review of your application to identify and secure any points where sensitive information might be exposed.

### CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
- **Description**: This issue arises when sensitive information is transmitted in cleartext, making it vulnerable to interception by attackers.
- **Solution**: Use encryption protocols such as TLS/SSL to protect data in transit.
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Recommendation**: Ensure that all data transmissions, especially those involving sensitive information, are encrypted using strong protocols.

### CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict
- **Description**: This occurs when different components interpret the same data differently, potentially leading to security issues.
- **Solution**: Standardize data formats and ensure consistent interpretation across all components.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Review your system architecture to identify and resolve any interpretation conflicts.

### CWE-525: Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information
- **Description**: This weakness involves storing sensitive information in the web browser cache, which can be accessed by unauthorized users.
- **Solution**: Use HTTP headers like Cache-Control and Pragma to prevent caching of sensitive information.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Configure your web server to include appropriate cache-control headers for pages containing sensitive data.

### CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking
- **Description**: This issue arises when applications rely on cookies without validating their integrity, making them susceptible to tampering.
- **Solution**: Implement mechanisms to validate the integrity of cookies, such as using cryptographic signatures.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Review your cookie handling practices and implement integrity checks to prevent tampering.

### CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute
- **Description**: Similar to CWE-1275, this involves cookies in HTTPS sessions lacking the 'Secure' attribute.
- **Solution**: Apply the 'Secure' attribute to all cookies in HTTPS sessions.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Ensure that all cookies used in secure sessions have the 'Secure' attribute set.

### CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
- **Description**: This weakness occurs when a security mechanism fails to provide its intended protection.
- **Solution**: Regularly test and verify the effectiveness of security mechanisms.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to ensure that protection mechanisms are functioning as intended.
